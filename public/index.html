        <div class="intro-text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beloved</i> is a renowned novel from Toni Morrison, one of the most prolific and
            influential writers of the 20th century. Set in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1873, the story blends unique portions
            of magical realism with incredibly empathetic and multi-dimensional characters while also touching on
            heart-wrenching topics like child loss, slavery, and, most of all, love.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While delving into the novel, I was intrigued by the recurring idea of
            memory and trauma, particularly the idea of intergenerational trauma carried by the main character. I have
            always been interested in aspects of psychology and Beloved provides a mature insight into the world of the
            characters’ psyches. Sethe as a character especially drew me in due to her struggle with the past and her
            attempts to deal with her trauma. Portions of the book written in Sethe’s stream of consciousness aided in
            developing her character and establishing the recurring idea of her “rememory” as well as the generational
            trauma caused by her history as a slave and her attempt to escape the fugitive slave catchers. Memory and
            the ideas around dealing with trauma are an integral part of <i>Beloved</i> and what I chose to focus on in
            this project.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the informational genre, I decided to focus on the Fugitive Slave Acts
            of 1793 and 1850. Providing context for such an abhorred era of U.S. history is crucial in understanding the
            foundation of intergenerational trauma for many ex-slaves. Sethe dealt with slave catchers in her history,
            leading to the ultimate act of murdering her child and her primary source of trauma. The Fugitive Slave Act
            created intense fear among all African Americans for a plethora of reasons and the psychological damage
            reverberates in all characters throughout <i>Beloved</i>, not just Sethe. The importance of Ohio as a
            setting and its surface level title as a “free state” also plays a role in Sethe’s history as a runaway
            slave. In providing context on these two topics, I hope to explore the historical reasons behind a culture
            of fear and shared trauma among ex-slaves and the families of those people.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final chapter of <i>Beloved</i> is a unique passage that provides a huge
            shift in perspective and ideas around trauma, love, and moving forward. I decided to provide an in-depth
            analysis on the passage, exploring its complex messages about how to best deal with abuse and trauma as the
            book comes to a close. Memory, trauma, and growth are all very present throughout the final chapter as the
            community strives to move on from Beloved. The chapter is unique in its delivery of the novel’s overall
            messages of healing and growth, however, as the community acts as a showcase of how not to heal wounds left
            by past trauma. Cryptic but full of Morrison’s talented literary skill, the last chapter is a perfect
            encapsulation of the book.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the creative piece, I wanted to step in the shoes of Denver as a baby
            during the scene in which Sethe kills Beloved. Denver is such a crucial character in <i>Beloved</i>
            especially concerning the idea of intergenerational trauma as Denver is the person who inherits the trauma
            from Sethe. I wanted to explore what it would be like for a baby to experience such an act with both a sense
            of confusion, childlike innocence, but also a lingering sense of horror. Sethe’s decision to kill Beloved
            was a large part of why Denver was so isolated as an adult and I wanted to explore her thoughts during that
            scene. I took inspiration from Chapter 22 of Beloved in which the novel takes the perspective of baby
            Beloved as she is in the land of the dead. The writing style in that chapter stuck with me due to its
            oddities and I decided to explore that world a little further.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the genres touch on the ideas of trauma, whether it’s understanding
            the historical reasons behind intergenerational trauma or a first-hand perspective of a traumatic
            experience. I believe that everyone should have the proper skills to deal with such memories and events and
            I hope that this website helps portray Toni Morrison’s message in a new and interactive manner.

            <div id="thesis">
                The Fugitive Slave Acts legalized the inhumane treatment of both enslaved and free people, creating an
                intense abolitionist opposition and a culture of fear among African Americans.
            </div>
            <div id="context">CONTEXT</div>
            <div>
                Initially passed in 1793, the Fugitive Slave Act stated that slave owners retained the right to search
                for escaped slaves in the borders of free states while also making the act of protecting escaped slaves
                illegal.
            </div>
            <div>
                In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act which further enforced the capture of escaped slaves,
                forcing citizens to aid in the recapturing of runaways.
            </div>
            <img src="images/fsa-ad.jpg" alt="Fugitive Slave Act Ad">
            <div>
                The new Fugitive Slave Act also mobilized the federal government to capture escaped slaves, giving them
                the right to issue warrants integral in capturing runaways.
            </div>
            <div>
                As a result of the act, the Underground Railroads gained immense popularity as a method to transfer
                escaped slaves.
            </div>
            <div>
                Furthermore, resistance grew among abolitionists as they became enraged with the government's advocacy
                of pro-slave legislation.
            </div>
            <div>
                African Americans grew afraid to be mistakenly recaptured themselves while also being fearful towards
                helping other escaped slaves due to the possible repercussions that could accompany such aid.

                OHIO: A "FREE" STATE
            </div>
            <div>
                Ohio was considered a free state in the 1800s, but not all slaves were considered free within the
                state's borders.
            </div>
            <div>
                While Ohio did prohibit the selling and purchasing of slaves, it did not prohibit the act of indentured
                servitude.
            </div>
            <div>
                Slave owners were allowed to bring their slaves into Ohio for an undetermined amount of time before they
                were freed. The threat of being sent back to enslaved states kept slaves under the influence of their
                master, further escalating the feeling of fear and control.
            </div>
            <img src="images/horse.jpg" alt="Slave being recaptured">
            <div>
                Cincinatti as a city provided rewards for the recapturing of slaves, fueling the idea that despite Ohio
                being a free state, it was complacent to the pro-slavery actions of the nation.
            </div>
            <div>
                Slaves believed in two versions of "freedom", one version granted by the slave owner and the federal
                government and one version that remained unattainable--true freedom. <i>Beloved</i> brings up this
                distinction between freedom as an allusion to the facade of freedom that many slaves faced as a result
                of the Fugitive Slave Acts.

            <p id="analysisPortion">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toni Morrison’s novel Beloved, the final chapter serves
                to conclude the ideas of love, trauma and acceptance. Beloved has been banished from 124 by the
                collective force of the community of women, saving Sethe from her parasitic grasp. Beloved, in this
                final chapter, symbolizes the ubiquitous mental affliction on African Americans caused by countless
                years of slavery and dehumanization. In the final pages, Morrison takes on a disembodied perspective and
                reveals the fate of Beloved along with the effect that she had on the community around 124, ultimately
                concluding that, in order to truly heal traumatic wounds and prevent intergenerational trauma, people
                must not dwell on the painful woes of the past but instead move forward through an emotional
                acknowledgement of one's history, while also recognizing the benefits of forgetting a traumatizing past.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the passage, the narrator establishes Beloved as a
                widely impactful and acknowledged figure, yet paradoxically forgettable despite her impact on the
                community. Morrison describes the contradictory circumstances of Beloved’s notoriety, stating,
                “Everybody knew what she was called, but nobody anywhere knew her name.” The community of 124 knew of
                Beloved and the damage she caused Sethe, but they didn’t truly know who she was and opted to forget her.
                Her lack of a name symbolizes not only the struggle that mothers experience during slavery, opting to
                not name their children due to the likelihood of them dying young, but it also signifies Morrison’s
                focus on hopefulness for a brighter future. Rather than dwelling on Beloved’s name and who she is, the
                community moves on. Beloved’s legacy is forgotten and her memory fades into nature, “[erupting] into her
                separate parts.” The idea that she splits into separate parts demonstrates Beloved’s multifaceted
                meaning, representing not only the lives lost in the horrific era of slavery, but also as a universal
                symbol for grief and pain as a result of historical trauma. Just as Beloved separates into distinct
                parts, some representing grief and pain while others represent love, those dealing with trauma must also
                separate their history into different pieces in order to more effectively deal with their abuse. More
                broadly, the community’s focus on forgetting Beloved supports the idea that forgetting a painful past
                can be an effective way of dealing with trauma, moving away from history into a brighter future filled
                with hope. Furthermore, the narrator states that the community believed that “remembering seemed
                unwise,” willingly forgetting Beloved because thinking about her is not productive to repairing the
                damage she left. This assertion demonstrates that ruminating on abuse suffered in the past is an
                unhelpful and damaging process which prevents one from moving forward.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the community’s aim to forget Beloved, the narrator depicts
                Beloved as ubiquitous and hidden within every inch of the community’s lives, illustrating the difficulty
                in forgetting past pain or trauma. The narrator describes that, “Occasionally, however, the rustle of a
                skirt hushes when they wake,” insinuating that the spirit of Beloved follows the lives of all those who
                came into contact with her long after she had been banished. Even after forgetting Beloved, her impact
                on the community remains hidden in the hushed corners of their lives, appearing in small moments when
                the community seems to finally forget her. Her constant appearance in the lives of others reflects how
                traumatic and painful memories are never truly forgotten but rather stowed in the subconscious of those
                who experienced them. Memories of abuse may seem to fade, but they always seem to appear in associations
                made many years ago. Photos of family, the movement of fabric, a breeze during sleep can all bring back
                long-forgotten memories of that abuse. Beloved had been banished for a long time, but her impact still
                shakes the people she interacted with. Similarly, even after slavery had been outlawed for decades, the
                remnants of the physical and emotional oppression still haunted the lives of many African Americans.
                Trauma stays with people even long after the event occurred, requiring those to find a way to deal with
                the memories in a healthy manner.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the passage, the narrator repeats the phrase “this is not a
                story to pass on” in order to establish a contradicting idea between telling Sethe and Beloved’s story
                while also saying to keep it hidden, ultimately illustrating that passing on a traumatic story can be a
                way to heal trauma when presented in a respectful and meaningful manner. The community of African
                Americans who experienced Beloved did not carry on her tale and tried to heal their grief and pain
                through forgetting, keeping her story inside. Morrison, through presenting Beloved’s story as a symbol
                of the lives lost during the tragic struggle of slavery, thus contradicts the narrator’s assertion that
                her story is not to be passed on. While the community strives to forget her, Morrison pushes the reader
                to remember Sethe and Beloved’s story as a way of honoring the African American lives that were lost as
                a result of enslavement. By writing a story about a historical figure which fought against the sins of
                slavery, Sethe and Beloved’s story is passed on, demonstrating that remembering painful times can be an
                effective way of dealing with suffering when done in a respectful manner, focused primarily on how to
                heal those wounds.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved’s last chapter assumes a disembodied perspective, focusing on
                the disappearance and lasting effects of Beloved on the community around 124. Beloved, acting as a
                symbol not only for pain and grief but also love and hopefulness, helps conclude the ideas of how to
                heal wounds left by trauma and the importance of dealing with past abuse in a meaningful and healthy
                way.
